# Migration — Repair a Repository Planned with Shortened v0.5.0 Prompts

## Purpose

Assess and repair a product repository that may have been migrated, initialized, or planned using abbreviated v0.5.0 prompt templates.

## Trigger

Use this migration when one or more of these occurred:

- the shortened v0.5.0 `update-to-latest-guide-system.md` prompt was used;
- a milestone package was generated from one of the shortened v0.5.0 milestone prompts;
- an implementation agent received the shortened v0.5.0 execution prompt;
- the resulting repository may have omitted guide-system obligations.

## Required assessment

Inspect the repository for omissions in:

- repository role and maturity classification;
- profile selection;
- authority-document routing;
- milestone scope and non-goals;
- provider/consumer distinction;
- validation tiers and concrete commands;
- human-review applicability and evidence;
- constrained-execution strategy;
- resumable validation suite requirements;
- direct documentation impact;
- deferred `.guide-sync/pending/` hints;
- implementation execution prompt;
- migration classification.

## Change classification

Classify findings as:

- required;
- conditional;
- already satisfied;
- manual review;
- no-op.

## Output

Create a focused corrective milestone package. Do not re-migrate or rewrite the repository wholesale when only a subset of requirements was omitted.
